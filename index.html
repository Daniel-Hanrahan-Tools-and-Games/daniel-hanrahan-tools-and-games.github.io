<h2>How I Became a successful Tool Builder/Developer</h2>
<ol>
<li>Find a need or find a problem that people need solving.</li>
<li>Build the hardware possibly needed for that tool.</li>
<li>Figure out the logic for the software possibly needed for that tool.</li>
<li>Write the software possibly needed for that tool.</li>
<li>Find all problems with hardware and software and fix them until it is perfected or near perfected.</li>
<li>Release/Publish the tool.</li>
<li>Tell people about it on Reddit on the correct subreddit for the tool or equivalents.</li>
<li>Listen to feedback and if there is anything wrong with the tool fix it and continue to make fixes and updates.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="concept1">concept1</h3>
<p>An app that works with a device that anyone can make that prints instaphotos that would make a digital copy as well. (can work on other portable printers) (some models would have their own Random Access Memory)</p>
<h3 id="concept2">concept2</h3>
<p>An app that works with a device that records footage on film reels as well as makes digital copies, some models also have their RAM and CPU and whenever someone wants to add more frame rate, the app will tell the users it will decrease storage on the reel.</p>
<h3 id="concept3">concept3</h3>
<p>A device where once you record on your phone it automatically records to a VHS, the device is wrapped around an arm and the user has to choose to record either in NTSC or PAL</p>
<h3 id="Flying Processor Unit Concept">Flying Processor Unit Concept</h3>
<p>It can measure a bunch of stuff using voltage from air sensors (sensors are placed at tips of wings) and make the wings do whatever they need to as well as change speed when necessary. It has its frequency reader</p>
<h3 id="Very Accurate Maps Concept">Very Accurate Maps Concept</h3>
<p>Uses a camera to see the stars to help determine the location as well as a compass module and GPS module.</p>
<h3 id="concept4">concept4</h3>
<p>A film projector that can play reels that has an extra sound strip so it can play music to MIDI devices.</p>
<h3 id="concept5">concept5</h3>
<p>A film projector that has an extra sound strip for taste and it is meant to express the taste of what one of the characters is eating.</p>
<h3 id="concept6">concept6</h3>
<p>An app that uses a Quantum Computer, Machine Learning, and a Nuclear Reactor that can do both fission and fusion to make new kinds of building materials, Machine learns how to make the new building materials, Quantum Computer Simulates that material, then the material is made using a nuclear reactor.</p>
<h3 id="concept7">concept7</h3>
<p>An app that uses a Quantum Computer that predicts stuff on gene editing and mutations from radiation.</p>
<h3 id="concept8">concept8</h3>
<p>A service where devs get paid to make personalized Video Games for other people.</p>
<h3 id="concept9">concept9</h3>
<p>A way to send MIDI data over the radio on a side band, it would be useful for synths, organs, and orchestrions.</p>
<h3 id="concept10">concept10</h3>
<p>An app that uses PWM to transmit messages by light using light and camera, the start is always 0, before the letter, and the end is always 1, after the letter.</p>
<h3 id="concept11">concept11</h3>
<p>An app for a Quantum Computer that chooses randomly how a movie goes.</p>
<h3 id="concept12">concept12</h3>
<p>An application that knows all of the world's tax codes or at least the U.S. Federal Tax Code and it tells you what you can do to lower your taxes to 0. It needs to know the amount donated to charity, losses, and income, and maybe the length of ownership of land.</p>
<h3 id="concept13">concept13</h3>
<p>An app that uses a Quantum Computer to simulate fireworks and anyone can use it to make new fireworks.</p>
<h3 id="concept14">concept14</h3>
<p>A camera that renders images in vector instead of raster using machine learning and a camera lucida.</p>
<h3 id="concept15">concept15</h3>
<p>a machine learning app that learns how software works on its native platform and then builds an emulator specific for that software based on the transistor level.</p>
<h3 id="concept16">concept16</h3>
<p>A machine learning app that learns any language very fast and learns every part of the language based on experience and test data and you tell if you want it to do in these languages using the languages you know.</p>
<h3 id="note_data_to_instrument concept expansion">note_data_to_instrument concept expansion</h3>
<p>The application would read the MIDI instrument ID for each note and send the Verilog file for each corresponding synthesizer to the FPGA.</p>
<h3 id="VoxelGPU">VoxelGPU</h3>
<p>A GPU that is optimized for voxels and not triangles. The GPU is very fast, it has a control unit that has instructions for the orientation of the voxel, what sides are showing, what arithmetic logic unit represents what side, and when to send pixel data to the screen for each side, it has three arithmetic logic units for each side of the voxel and a one-megabyte cache. The GPU hardware is an FPGA.</p>
<h3 id="concept17">concept17</h3>
<p>A building where most of the wiring is done by FPGA in order to easily rewire the building.</p>
<h3 id="concept18">concept18</h3>
<p>A way to render light from water waves and it uses a quantum computer to see if light bounces back from wave or not every nanosecond and it uses a matrix processing unit like a TPU to see if there will be a rainbow or not and where the colors of the rainbow go.</p>
<h3 id="concept19">concept19</h3>
<p>A Humanoid Robot that has nine FPGAs so it can do any type of classical processing and there are three types of classical processing, serial processing like modern-day CPUs, parallel processing like modern-day GPUs, and matrix processing like modern-day TPUs, and machine learning AI determines what processing it needs for the robot to do, for the task it needs to do.</p>
