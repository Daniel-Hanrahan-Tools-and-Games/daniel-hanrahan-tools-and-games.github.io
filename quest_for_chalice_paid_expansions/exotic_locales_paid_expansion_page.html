<p><a href="mailto:danielhanrahantng@gmail.com">If you would like this expansion or have this expansion in your own game streaming service, please attempt to contact me here and we will negotiate the transaction for a copy of this expansion or the transactions for having the expansion on your game streaming service, the contract to put this expansion on your streaming service must have an enshittification clause with no non-disclosures or exclusivity parts of any kind tied to the enshittification clause and it would be about you, me, customers and the last 2 things employees and shareholders/members if need be, the reason we have to negotiate the transactions for the expansion is because of what happened to Valve the owners of the Steam store and Itch.io, why the enshittification clause is neccessary, look what happened to Netflix, Nintendo and Adobe, their services have been terrible lately, plus I see how inflation is affecting everyone terribly.</a></p>
