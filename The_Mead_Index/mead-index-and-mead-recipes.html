<p>warning: all these tastes came from the non alcoholic versions of the drinks and this is only one dimension of the mead index, does not cover all dimesions of the mead index and these drinks are very controversial as in some people like one or some of the drinks but not the others and some people do not exactly like them at all.</p>
<h2>Recipes</h2>
<p>F.Y.I. and warnings: The recipes shown here can be distributed in any way shape or form to anyone in the U.S. if the drinks are boiled for 3 hours which removes the alcohol, sources: https://www.isu.edu/news/2019-fall/no-worries-the-alcohol-burns-off-during-cookingbut-does-it-really.html and I have tested this for myself and I could not taste a single drop of alcohol after this process and I am sensitive to alcohol, and because well I do not know how to word this but these drinks are considered nonalcoholic if you boil the drinks for 3 hours under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, source: https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title27/chapter8&edition=prelim, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, states and municipalities can have their own laws on what alcohol is in the U.S. so I do recommend talking to an alcohol lawyer if you the person reading this wants to distribute it in a very specific state or municipality in the U.S. or anywhere in the U.S. and I cannot give you any info about alcohol laws in other countries, The recipes are dog safe. Make sure that everything that touches your drinks or ingredients of drinks and tools are cleaned and sanitized. For anything that happens in mead making process or mead distribution process I am not responsible so MAKE AND DISTRIBUTE MEAD AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
